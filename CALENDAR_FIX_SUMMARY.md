# Calendar Frontend Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Date Parsing Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: The API returns ISO date strings with timezone (`2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z`) but the frontend was parsing these through `new Date()` which applies local timezone conversion, causing date key mismatches.
- **Solution**: Changed from `format(new Date(samagam.date), "yyyy-MM-dd")` to `samagam.date.split('T')[0]` to extract just the date part (`2025-05-29`) before processing.

### 2. **Calendar Highlighting Enhancement** ✅
- **Problem**: Calendar dates with samagams were not prominently highlighted.
- **Solution**: Enhanced `modifiersClassNames` to use more visible highlighting with `bg-primary/30 text-primary-foreground font-bold ring-2 ring-primary ring-offset-1 hover:bg-primary/40`.

### 3. **Color Dots Visibility** ✅
- **Problem**: Color dots indicating samagams on calendar dates were too small and not visible enough.
- **Solution**: Increased dot size from `w-2 h-2` to `w-2.5 h-2.5` with enhanced shadow and border styling.

### 4. **Duplicate API Routes** ✅
- **Problem**: There were duplicate calendar endpoints in `routes.ts` that could cause conflicts.
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate `/api/samagams/calendar` route, keeping only the first properly placed one.

### 5. **Simplified Modifier Logic** ✅
- **Problem**: Calendar modifiers used complex function-based checking.
- **Solution**: Simplified to use direct date array checking for better performance and reliability.

## Code Changes Made

### `/client/src/components/calendar-modal.tsx`
```tsx
// OLD: Timezone conversion causing issues
const dateKey = format(new Date(samagam.date), "yyyy-MM-dd");

// NEW: Direct date extraction
const dateOnly = samagam.date.split('T')[0];
```

### `/server/routes.ts`
- Removed duplicate calendar endpoint that was appearing after the `:id` route

## Testing Status
- ✅ API returns correct data: `[{"id":7,"title":"title","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","color":"#3B82F6"}]`
- ✅ Server restarted successfully 
- ✅ Date parsing logic verified
- ✅ Calendar modal enhanced with better styling
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

## Expected Behavior
1. **May 29th, 2025** should now be highlighted in the calendar modal
2. **Color dots** should be visible on dates with samagams
3. **Clicking on May 29th** should navigate to the samagam details page
4. **Calendar modal** should open when clicking the calendar button on the home page

## Debug Information
- Console logs added to track date processing and modifier application
- API endpoint verified working correctly
- Date parsing tested: `"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z".split('T')[0]` = `"2025-05-29"`

The calendar should now be fully functional with proper date highlighting and navigation!
